# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gather the number of employees that are within the requirements for upcoming retirement and determine whether the company is prepared for the upcoming loss of experienced employees. 

## Results
* There are currently 72,458 employees preparing to enter retirement and that is roughly 30% of the total existing staff for each job title.
* While Senior Engineers are retiring the most, this job title is the most populated in the company. It looks like senior staff will be the largest affected percentage-wise.
* Ufortunately there are no employees eligible to step into the mentorship role for Managers. 
* While the mentorship outlook looks bleak it's a good sign that it could be a while before the company experiences another tsunami of retirement.
